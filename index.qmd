title: The Missing Course for Cognitive Sciences
subtitle: Essentials of Computing for Cognitive Sciences and Humanities
---

Graduate courses in cognitive sciences typically focus on advanced topics such as statistical methods, psychometrics, or brain imaging. And students are often left to teach themselves the very tools they use on a daily basis: computers. This hands-on workshop fills that gap by providing a structured introduction to the essentials of computing for research.

The course provides a gentle intro to programming for highly motivated students with little or no prior experience in programming computers. The focus is on using Python for use cases in humanities and cognitive sciences.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to:

- Write Python code confidently 
- Apply essential programming techniques (e.g., structuring projects, implementing everyday machine learning workflows) 
- Use software engineering methods (specification and diagramming, peer coding, RegEx) 
- Apply version control and reproducible data management to their projects (Git, DVC) 
- Use the command line and integrated development environments effectively. 
- Publish scientific websites and documents with Markdown and Quarto 
- Apply physical computing to research tasks using Micro:bit and Raspberry Pi 5

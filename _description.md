# The Missing Course: Essentials of Computing for Humanities

## Course description

This hands-on workshop addresses a critical but often overlooked component of graduate training: practical computing skills.
Graduate courses typically focus on advanced topics such as statistical methods, psychometrics, or brain imaging. And students are often left to teach themselves the very tools they use on a daily basis: computers. This course fills that gap by providing a structured introduction to essential computing practices for research.
Participants will gain both conceptual understanding and practical skills in software development and tools:
Essential programming for scientific softwares (Python, data and project organization)
Physical computing using Micro:bit and Raspberry Pi 5 as simplified models for advanced hardwares
Command-lines and connecting to the remote resources
Collaboration and reproducibility techniques: environment management (e.g., PIP/UV and Conda/Pixi), version control (e.g., Git), data management (e.g., DVC and data formats), basic software diagramming techniques (e.g., UML, BPMN), and scientific web development (Markdown and Quarto) 
Everyday machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn)


## Learning outcomes
By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to: 
- Write Python code confidently 
- Apply essential programming techniques (e.g., structuring projects, implementing everyday machine learning workflows) 
- Use software engineering methods (specification and diagramming, peer coding, RegEx) 
- Apply version control and reproducible data management to their projects (Git, DVC) 
- Use the command line and integrated development environments effectively. 
- Publish scientific websites and documents with Markdown and Quarto 
- Apply physical computing to research tasks using Micro:bit and Raspberry Pi 5

## Logistics
Location: We need a room with whiteboards and screen/mouse/keyboard (for joint programming). Possible options are the Learning Centre or the UserLab. 
Computers: To ensure a consistent learning environment across the various platforms students use (Windows, macOS, Linux), we will use low-cost computing boards (BBC micro:bit and Raspberry Pi 5). These boards will be provided by the xCIT/UserLab.

## Additional notes

This course will provide a gentle intro to programming for highly motivated students with little or no prior experience in programming computers. We will focus on using the Python for use cases in humanities and cognitive sciences. Lectures will be interactive featuring in-class exercises.

Last lecture will be advanced topics about data, software, and devices:
- data formats
- functional programming
- Large models and RPi AI HAT

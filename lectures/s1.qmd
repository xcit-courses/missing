The BBC micro:bit is a pocket-sized programmable computer with several inputs and outputs built in (e.g., buttons, speaker, motion detector, compass, display, wireless radio communication).

Micro:bit can be programmed using an online Python editor, so no need to install anything, and no platform dependency.

## Part 1

### Hardware

:::{layout="[10,2]"}

[BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) is a pocket-sized programmable computer with several inputs and outputs built in (e.g., buttons, speaker, motion detector, compass, display, wireless radio communication).

:::

Micro:bit can be programmed using an online editor, so you don't need to install anything, and there is no platform dependency.

### Software

We will use [Python](https://python.org) to program the micro:bit. Python is a popular programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is widely used for data science, artificial intelligence, web development, and scientific computing.

Python is an interpreted language, which means that you can run your code without compiling it first. This makes it easy to test and debug your code.

Here is an example of a simple Python program that displays a heart on the micro:bit's LED display and then scrolls the text "Hello Brain" across the display:

```python
from microbit import display, Image, sleep         # <1>

# repeat forever                        # <2>
while True:                             # <3>
    display.show(Image.SKULL)           # <4>
    sleep(1000)                         # <5>
    display.scroll('Hello Brain')       # <6>
```

1. Import the necessary modules from the micro:bit library.
2. A comment in Python starts with a `#` symbol (to the end of the line) and is ignored by the interpreter.
2. Start an infinite loop.
3. Display a skull image on the micro:bit's LED display.
4. Pause for 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
5. Scroll the text "Hello Brain" across the LED display.

### Basics of Python

Here are some basic concepts of Python that we will cover in this session:

- REPL
- expressions
- variables
- types (int, float, str, bool)
- print
- assignment
- mutable vs immutable
- basic built-in functions (type, len, int, float, str)
- fstring
- comments
- conditions
- loops, range, break, continue
- collections (list, tuple, dict, set)
- dictionaries
- functions
- abstraction (pure/impure, side effects, reuse)
- files
- data files
- handling errors
- math
- modules/libs (math, random, time)

### Getting Started

1. Go to the [Micro:bit Python Editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/3).
2. Connect your micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Write your Python code in the editor.
4. Click the "Send to micro:bit" button to upload your code to the micro:bit.
5. The code will run automatically on the micro:bit.


## Part 2: Notebooks and Dependencies
